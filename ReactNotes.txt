React JS is a library.It is NOT a framework like Angular / Vue JS.
React JS is not having its own router. We have to install extra package react-router-dom. 
It has entire eco-system of packageto install to make it function as a full fledge framework.
MVC framework :-
Model deals with Data
Conroller deals witn requests & routing  
View is User Interface
Why we should use React ?
    - It structures the View layer of the application
    - It has re-usable components which hold their own state & data
    - JSX - Javascript Syntax Extension - It allows us to write dynamic HTML
    - Apps which are built with react are interactive as it uses Virtual dom. 
    Bceuase of that we do not have refresh the page. 
    - All the data in the state is immutable. It means we can not modify (mutate) it directly    

Components in React :-
    It render/return JSX (JSX) - it looks like HTML
    We can embed components into another components 
    Components are dynamic mock-up - they can contain states
    state - detemines how a component renders & behaves
    Any data that is displayed in component is state
