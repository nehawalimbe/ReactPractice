React JS is a library.It is NOT a framework like Angular / Vue JS.
React JS is not having its own router. We have to install extra package react-router-dom. 
It has entire eco-system of packageto install to make it function as a full fledge framework.
MVC framework :-
Model deals with Data
Conroller deals witn requests & routing  
View is User Interface
Why we should use React ?
    - It structures the View layer of the application
    - It has re-usable components which hold their own state & data
    - JSX - Javascript Syntax Extension - It allows us to write dynamic HTML
    - Apps which are built with react are interactive as it uses Virtual dom. 
    Bceuase of that we do not have refresh the page. 
    - All the data in the state is immutable. It means we can not modify (mutate) it directly    

Components in React :-
    It render/return JSX (JSX) - it looks like HTML
    We can embed components into another components 
    Components are dynamic mock-up - they can contain states
    state - detemines how a component renders & behaves
    Any data that is displayed in component is state

States in react :-
In order to share data within multiple compoenent use "App" state or "global" state.
If there are ton of App level states, that gets difficult to manage. In that case we can use :-
Context API OR REDUX

Create React App :-
    Use NPM version > 5.2
    Use below command :- 
        npx create-react-app react-task-tracker

Below packages are present in package.json file of the project :-
react-dom - is responsible for rendering the DOM
react-scripts - it has development server, build tool

index.html is only 1 HTML used - it is a single page application.
It has <div id="root"></div>
It is the entry point of the react application
